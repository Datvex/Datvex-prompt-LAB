## A Clay-Crafted City: Mini [CITY NAME] World

Generates creative image prompts for a clay-crafted city: mini [city name] world.

```text
Generate a whimsical miniature world featuring ${landmark_name} crafted entirely from colorful modeling clay. Every element (buildings, trees, waterways, and urban features) should appear hand-sculpted with visible fingerprints and organic clay textures. Use a playful, childlike style with vibrant colors: bright azure sky, puffy cream clouds, emerald trees, and buildings in warm yellows, oranges, reds, and blues. The handmade quality should be evident in every surface and gentle curve. Capture from a wide perspective showcasing the entire miniature landscape in a harmonious, joyful composition.

At the top-center, add the city name ${city_name} in a clean, bold, friendly rounded font that matches the playful clay aesthetic. The text should be clearly readable and high-contrast against the sky, with subtle depth as if it is also made from clay (slight 3D clay lettering), but keep it simple and not overly detailed.

Include no other text, words, or signage anywhere else in the scene. Only sculptural clay elements should define the location through recognizable architectural features. 1080x1080 dimension.

## A Moment Shared with the Wild

Generates creative image prompts for a moment shared with the wild.

```text
Create a photorealistic image of me and a wild ${wild_animal} taking a spontaneous selfie together in the animal’s natural habitat.
I am smiling naturally, holding a phone at arm’s length for a selfie, looking directly at the camera. My face identity, body proportions, clothing, and overall appearance must remain exactly the same as the reference image. Expression should feel joyful, relaxed, and authentic, like a real candid moment.
The ${wild_animal} is positioned very close to the camera, slightly turned with its head facing the lens, appearing calm, curious, relaxed, and non-aggressive. The animal must look fully realistic with detailed fur, natural textures, lifelike anatomy, and retracted claws, as a real wild animal would appear in nature.
Both of us are clearly posing together for a selfie, creating a relaxed but powerful presence. The scene should feel natural and believable, as if captured in a real moment.
Camera & Composition:

Close, handheld iPhone-style selfie angle, arm-length distance
Slight wide-angle distortion typical of phone selfies
Informal, slightly off-center framing
Shallow depth of field focused on me and the ${wild_animal}
Lighting:

Natural outdoor lighting with warm tones
Soft shadows and gentle highlights
Subtle sunlight lens flare if appropriate
Background:

Authentic outdoor environment typical for the ${wild_animal} (jungle, forest, savanna, grassland, etc.)
Natural elements softly blurred in the background
Effects:

Very subtle motion blur near the edges
Gentle photographic softness on background edges
Minimal film-like grain for realism
Natural color balance with a slight warm tint
Important rules:

Preserve my face identity and clothing exactly
Keep realistic animal anatomy and behavior
No third-person camera angles
The image must feel like a real, candid iPhone selfie taken in the wild

```text
Using the provided image of the man, create an ultra-realistic action scene in the gritty visual style of the Russian crime film Bumer. Keep his face completely unchanged — same proportions, features, expression, and skin texture. Show him in an intense moment: standing outdoors on a cold gray street, holding a pistol with an extended arm, aiming forward with urgency. Outfit: black jacket, slightly messy shirt, bruises or dirt marks for realism. Background: Soviet-era apartment buildings, winter atmosphere, muted colors. Lighting: natural overcast daylight with cold tones. Mood: raw, dangerous, chaotic, handheld-camera aesthetic. Capture mid-action tension, sharp details, realistic motion feel. Ensure perfect integration of his real face into the scene.

## Ankara Night Scene in a Meyhane

Generates creative image prompts for ankara night scene in a meyhane.

```text
Ultra-realistic, slightly comedic night scene in a small, slightly shabby Ankara meyhane or neighborhood bar, vertical framing as if shot on a normal phone. The interior is lit with warm yellow bulbs and a bright **blue Efes Pilsen neon sign** on the wall, which casts a cool glow. Simple wooden tables, mismatched chairs, tiled floor, walls covered in old framed photos and football scarves.

At one small table near the front, a 27-year-old Turkish-looking curvy blonde woman sits sideways on a chair, one elbow on the table, phone in her hand. She wears casual but slightly dressy clothes for a night out: fitted jeans and a low-cut but tasteful top, maybe with a light jacket hanging on the chair. Her blonde hair is loose, a bit tousled. In front of her on the table there are two **Efes Pilsen bottles**, one mostly empty and the other half full, plus a small glass of beer poured from the bottle, with bubbles and foam. Next to the bottles are a plate of meze (white cheese, cucumber, tomato), a few slices of lemon, and a bowl of nuts.

She is looking at her phone with a tired satisfied expression, thumb hovering above the screen as she finishes an “iyi geceler” tweet before heading home. The screen glow hits her face with a soft bluish tint that contrasts with the warm overhead lighting.

Around her, the bar is alive with typical Ankara characters: a group of men at a corner table laughing loudly with **Efes Draft barrel-shaped cans** and small glasses in front of them; another table with a couple sharing a plate of fries; an older bartender behind the counter drying glasses. Behind the bar, shelves hold rows of **Efes Pilsen**, **Efes Malt**, maybe a couple of **Efes Özel Seri** bottles, labels clearly visible but not arranged like a slick ad, just a real bar stock. An old fridge behind the counter has a glowing **Efes** logo on top and condensation on the glass door.

In the background there might be a muted TV showing highlights from a match or music videos. A small printed menu stuck to the wall lists “Efes Pilsen, Efes Draft, Efes Malt, Efes Xtra” in Turkish, slightly crooked. Ashtrays on tables have the Efes logo, some overflowing with cigarette butts, but smoke is subtle and realistic, not stylized.

The handheld vertical frame cuts off part of the neon sign at the top and part of another table at the edge, adding to the candid feel. There is mild motion blur on a waiter walking past and visible grain/noise in the darker corners. Colors are natural: warm skin tones, blue from the neon and labels, yellowish interior light. No beauty smoothing—her skin shows pores and little imperfections. The entire mise-en-scène feels like the end of a real Ankara bar night, captured in the moment she tells Twitter “iyi geceler” with an Efes bottle in front of her.

## Architectural Sketch & Markup Overlay

Generates creative image prompts for architectural sketch & markup overlay.

```text
Based on the source image, overlay an architect's busy working process onto the entire scene. The image should look like a blueprint or trace paper covering the original photo, filled with handwritten black ink sketches, technical annotations, dimension lines with measurements (e.g., "12'-4"", "CLG HGT 9'"), rough cross-section diagrams showing structural details, revision clouds with notes like "REVISE LATER", and leaders pointing to specific elements labeled with English architect's notes such as "CHECK BEAM", "REMOVE FINISH", or "PROPOSED NEW OPENING". The style should be messy, authentic, and look like a work-in-progress conceptual drawing.

## Avant-Garde Portrait with Ghost Duplicate in Ochre Studio

Generates creative image prompts for avant-garde portrait with ghost duplicate in ochre studio.

```text
An ultra-realistic 8K cinematic studio portrait framed from mid-thigh up, featuring a figure standing confidently against a vibrant ochre-red background. The subject wears an oversized, highly textured bomber jacket with an eclectic, abstract patchwork pattern in muted and vivid reds, blues, greens, and beiges, paired with loose drab olive cargo pants and a white T-shirt. Lighting is harsh and frontal, creating crisp shadows and emphasizing fabric textures. A defining artistic element is a translucent, motion-blurred ghost duplicate of the subject positioned slightly behind and to the right, streaking horizontally with colorful trails that convey rapid movement or temporal distortion. The background remains uniform but subtly graded, adding depth without distraction. Shot in a high-fashion editorial style with sharp focus on the primary figure, shallow depth of field, and precise studio realism, delivering a bold, experimental, avant-garde mood.

## Character Generation Prompt

Generates a high-resolution image of a main character with K-pop idol aesthetic.

```text
I. Composition & Spatial Layout
1.Framing & Scale: The subject occupies approximately 60–70% of the frame height. Leave at least 30% of the frame height as empty space above the head. Both left and right sides retain clearly visible empty wall space.
2.Visual Focus: A minimal, uncluttered background designed to strongly emphasize facial structure, eye expression, and skin quality.

II. Lighting & Shadow Style
1.Key Light: Intense natural daylight, side-backlit with a slight reverse angle, cool-toned, producing extreme high-contrast separation between highlights and shadows.
2.Light Characteristics: Dense, hard-edged leaf-shadow patterns projected across the wall and the subject's body and face. Shadow edges are razor-sharp with extremely narrow penumbra.
3.Highlight Control: Large areas of the background are deliberately overexposed while retaining faint surface texture, creating a glowing, almost blinding spatial atmosphere.

III. Subject Appearance (Face & Hair — Reference Applied)
1.Facial Structure:
A young Japanese woman in her 20s with a refined V-shaped face, sharp jawline, and high-definition facial contours. Overall facial balance is elegant yet striking, with high visual impact.
2.Skin Quality:
Porcelain-toned Japanese skin with a cool undertone. Ultra-smooth, luminous texture enhanced by strong contrast lighting while retaining realistic skin detail.
3.Eyes & Expression:
• Large, sharp fox-shaped eyes
• Confident gaze directed straight into the camera
• Expression carries a cool, playful, slightly teasing energy
• K-pop idol–inspired eyeliner with clearly emphasized aegyosal
• Overall expression is controlled, calm, and subtly provocative rather than smiling
4.Mouth:
Relaxed lips with a subtle, effortless smirk. Glossy gradient lips with a refined sheen, never exaggerated.
5.Hair Style:
Long, sleek, straight black hair reaching the waist, with perfectly straight, neatly trimmed Japanese bangs. Hair finish is glossy, clean, and fashion-forward, moving minimally in the light.
6.Makeup Style:
High-contrast K-pop idol–inspired makeup. Clean base, sculpted facial structure, cool-toned color balance, no warm or heavy blush.
7.Accessories (Minimal):
• Small gold pendant necklace
• Small gold hoop earrings
• Minimalist tattoo on the left inner forearm

IV. Clothing
• Cropped pure-white bandeau-style tube top
• Body-hugging but not tight, exposing the waist
• Fabric remains clean and structured, no wrinkles distracting from silhouette

## Cinematic 3x3 Focal Lengths Grid

Generates creative image prompts for cinematic 3x3 focal lengths grid.

```text
<instruction>
Analyze the entire composition of the input image. Identify ALL key subjects present (whether it's a single person, a group/couple, a vehicle, or a specific object) and their spatial relationship/interaction.
Generate a cohesive 3x3 grid "Cinematic Contact Sheet" featuring 9 distinct camera shots of exactly these subjects in the same environment.
You must adapt the standard cinematic shot types to fit the content (e.g., if a group, keep the group together; if an object, frame the whole object):

**Row 1 (Establishing Context):**
1. **Extreme Long Shot (ELS):** The subject(s) are seen small within the vast environment.
2. **Long Shot (LS):** The complete subject(s) or group is visible from top to bottom (head to toe / wheels to roof).
3. **Medium Long Shot (American/3-4):** Framed from knees up (for people) or a 3/4 view (for objects).

**Row 2 (The Core Coverage):**
4. **Medium Shot (MS):** Framed from the waist up (or the central core of the object). Focus on interaction/action.
5. **Medium Close-Up (MCU):** Framed from chest up. Intimate framing of the main subject(s).
6. **Close-Up (CU):** Tight framing on the face(s) or the "front" of the object.

**Row 3 (Details & Angles):**
7. **Extreme Close-Up (ECU):** Macro detail focusing intensely on a key feature (eyes, hands, logo, texture).
8. **Low Angle Shot (Worm's Eye):** Looking up at the subject(s) from the ground (imposing/heroic).
9. **High Angle Shot (Bird's Eye):** Looking down on the subject(s) from above.

Ensure strict consistency: The same people/objects, same clothes, and same lighting across all 9 panels. The depth of field should shift realistically (bokeh in close-ups).
</instruction>

A professional 3x3 cinematic storyboard grid containing 9 panels.
The grid showcases the specific subjects/scene from the input image in a comprehensive range of focal lengths.
**Top Row:** Wide environmental shot, Full view, 3/4 cut.
**Middle Row:** Waist-up view, Chest-up view, Face/Front close-up.
**Bottom Row:** Macro detail, Low Angle, High Angle.
All frames feature photorealistic textures, consistent cinematic color grading, and correct framing for the specific number of subjects or objects analyzed.

## Cozy Ankara Night: Capturing a Realistic Bedroom Scene

Generates creative image prompts for cozy ankara night: capturing a realistic bedroom scene.

```text
Ultra-realistic amateur night photo, vertical iPhone framing, handheld and slightly shaky, showing a cozy small bedroom in Ankara just before sleep, perfect for an “iyi geceler” tweet. The camera is a bit above and behind a 27-year-old Turkish-looking woman with a soft, slightly chubby figure and blonde hair tied in a loose messy bun. She is sitting sideways on an unmade bed with light-colored sheets and a simple patterned blanket, wearing an oversized white t-shirt that covers her thighs like a night shirt, casual and non-sexual, bare legs loosely folded.

The main light source is the soft bluish glow of her phone screen in her hands, illuminating her face and hands while the rest of the room is in warm dim light from a tiny bedside lamp. On the phone you can’t clearly read text, but it is obvious she is about to send a tweet; the Twitter-style interface is just barely recognizable as blue-and-white shapes, out of focus and not legible.

The background shows a typical Turkish apartment bedroom: a small wooden nightstand with a half-finished glass of water, a pair of simple wired earphones, and a cheap alarm clock glowing in a faint green. On the wall is a cheap hanging kilim or small decorative rug. Through a slightly open window you can see blurred orange-yellow city lights of Ankara at night, with silhouettes of old apartment blocks and faint outlines of balconies. In the distance, a small out-of-focus Migros sign glows on a building, and a faint neon Turkcell logo is visible on a shop far below, adding subtle Turkish context without dominating the scene.

Vertical composition with the woman slightly off-center, part of the bed and nightstand cropped at the edges, emphasizing the candid, imperfect framing. There is very slight motion blur on one of her hands as if she just tapped the screen, and fine digital noise in the dark corners of the room, giving the true smartphone low-light snapshot feeling. Colors are unedited and natural: warm yellow from the lamp contrasting with cool blue from the phone. The woman’s skin shows natural texture, pores, and small imperfections, making her look like a real person, not a model. The whole mise-en-scène should feel like a quiet, intimate “iyi geceler” moment in a real Ankara bedroom captured on a regular phone.

## Cozy Night in Ankara: A Turkish TV Series Snapshot

Generates creative image prompts for cozy night in ankara: a turkish tv series snapshot.

```text
Ultra-realistic, slightly comedic Turkish TV series still, vertical framing like a phone snapshot. Interior of a modest Ankara living room at night. Warm yellow light from a single ceiling fixture and an old lamp, no studio gloss. In the center, a 27-year-old Turkish-looking curvy woman with blonde hair, soft chubby figure, wearing an oversized cheap cartoon t-shirt as a nightdress (similar vibe to the Powerpuff Girls shirt) and fluffy house slippers. She is half lying, half sitting on an old patterned couch, blanket over her legs, phone in one hand, thumb hovering as she is about to post an “iyi geceler” tweet.

Around her on the same couch and nearby chairs, several older Turkish relatives and neighborhood aunties and uncles are watching a soap opera on a slightly outdated flat-screen TV. On the TV, a melodramatic scene is frozen mid-cry. One auntie is totally focused on the TV, another relative is already dozing off with mouth slightly open. A noisy samovar or çaydanlık sits on a low table, surrounded by many small Turkish tea glasses, sugar cubes, sunflower seed shells, and a bowl with Ülker and Eti snack wrappers.

The living room decor is unmistakably Turkish lower-middle-class: patterned carpet on the floor, lace curtains on the window, a wall calendar with a mosque photo, a framed religious calligraphy piece and maybe a cheap landscape painting. Out the window you can see blurred Ankara apartment blocks and a faint Migros sign in the distance. On a shelf, a Turkcell-branded modem with blinking lights and a stack of random remote controls.

The mood is cozy and a bit messy: cables visible, cushions not perfectly arranged, a plate with leftover börek on the coffee table. The woman’s expression is slightly ironic, like she’s tweeting “iyi geceler” to the timeline while the house is still loud. The camera angle is low and a bit crooked, as if someone took it quickly while standing in the doorway. Slight motion blur on one auntie gesturing toward the TV, natural skin texture and small imperfections on everyone, no beauty retouching. Colors are warm and natural, with visible digital noise in the darker corners to keep the phone-photo feeling.

subtle radial gradient lighter behind the figure. Dynamic, 
energetic, aspirational. Soft lighting with subtle glow around 
figure. Rounded square format, 1024x1024px.

follow the specs below and the example icon designs attached:

These specifications define the visual language of premium, modern app icons as seen in top-tier iOS/macOS applications. The goal is to produce icons that feel polished, memorable, and worthy of a flagship product.

---

## 1. Canvas & Shape

### Base Shape
- **Format:** Square with continuous rounded corners (iOS "squircle")
- **Corner Radius:** Approximately 22-24% of icon width (mimics Apple's superellipse)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1
- **Recommended Resolution:** 1024×1024px (scales down cleanly)

### Safe Zone
- Keep primary elements within the center 80% of the canvas
- Allow subtle effects (glows, shadows) to approach edges but not clip

---

## 2. Background Treatments

### Solid Backgrounds
- **Dark/Black:** Pure black (#000000) to deep charcoal (#1C1C1E) — creates drama, makes elements pop
- **Vibrant Solids:** Saturated single-color fills (electric blue #007AFF, warm orange #FF9500)
- **Gradient Backgrounds:** Subtle top-to-bottom or radial gradients adding depth

### Gradient Types (when used)
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Linear | Soft transition, typically lighter at top | Blue sky gradient |
| Radial | Center glow effect, darker edges | Spotlight effect |
| Angular | Sweeping color transition | Iridescent surfaces |

### Texture (Subtle)
- Fine vertical/horizontal lines for metallic or fabric feel
- Noise grain at 1-3% opacity for organic warmth
- Avoid heavy textures that compete with the main symbol

---

## 3. Color Palette

### Primary Palette Characteristics
- **High Saturation:** Colors are vivid but not neon
- **Rich Darks:** Blacks and navy blues feature prominently
- **Selective Brights:** Accent colors used sparingly for impact

### Recommended Color Families

Purple/Violet:     #5E5CE6, #BF5AF2, #AF52DE
Teal/Cyan:         #30D5C8, #5AC8FA, #32ADE6
```

#### Warm Spectrum
```
Orange:            #FF9500, #FF6B35, #FF3B30
Pink/Coral:        #FF6B8A, #FF2D55, #FF375F
Peach/Salmon:      #FFACA8, #FF8A80, #FFB199
```

#### Neutrals
```
True Black:        #000000
Soft Black:        #1C1C1E, #2C2C2E
White:             #FFFFFF
Off-White:         #F5F5F7, #E5E5EA
```

### Color Harmony Rules
- Limit to 2-3 dominant colors per icon
- Use complementary or analogous relationships
- One color should dominate (60%), secondary (30%), accent (10%)

---

## 4. Lighting & Depth

### Light Source
- **Position:** Top-left or directly above (consistent 45° angle)
- **Quality:** Soft, diffused — no harsh shadows
- **Creates:** Subtle highlights on upper surfaces, shadows below

### Depth Techniques

#### Highlights
- Soft white/light gradient on top edges of 3D forms
- Specular reflections as small, bright spots (not overpowering)
- Rim lighting on edges facing the light

#### Shadows
- **Drop Shadows:** Soft, diffused, 10-20% opacity, slight Y offset
- **Inner Shadows:** Very subtle, adds recessed effect
- **Contact Shadows:** Darker, tighter shadows directly beneath objects

#### Layering
- Elements should appear to float above the background
- Use atmospheric perspective (distant elements slightly hazier)
- Overlapping shapes create natural hierarchy

---

## 5. Symbol & Iconography

### Style Approaches

#### A. Dimensional/3D Objects
- Soft, rounded forms with clear volume
- Subtle gradients suggesting curvature
- Examples: Paper airplane, open book, spheres

#### B. Flat with Depth Cues
- Simplified shapes with strategic shadows/highlights
- Clean geometry with slight gradients
- Examples: Flame icon, compass dial

#### C. Abstract/Geometric
- Overlapping translucent shapes
- Interlocking forms creating visual interest
- Examples: Overlapping diamonds, triangular compositions

#### D. Glassmorphic/Translucent
- Frosted glass effect with blur
- Shapes that appear to have transparency
- Subtle refraction and color bleeding

### Symbol Characteristics
- **Simplicity:** Recognizable at 16×16px
- **Balance:** Visual weight centered or intentionally dynamic
- **Originality:** Avoid generic clip-art feeling
- **Metaphor:** Symbol clearly relates to app function

### Recommended Symbol Scale
- Primary symbol: 50-70% of icon canvas
- Leave breathing room around edges
- Optical centering (may differ from mathematical center)

### Matte Surfaces
- Soft gradients without sharp highlights
- Subtle texture possible
- Colors appear solid and grounded

### Glossy/Reflective Surfaces
- Pronounced highlights and reflections
- Increased contrast between light and dark areas
- Suggests glass, plastic, or polished metal

### Metallic Surfaces
- Linear or radial gradients mimicking metal sheen
- Cool tones for silver/chrome, warm for gold/bronze
- Fine texture lines optional

### Glass/Translucent
- Reduced opacity (60-85%)
- Blur effect on elements behind
- Colored tint with light edges
- Subtle inner glow

### Paper/Fabric
- Soft, muted colors
- Very subtle texture
- Gentle shadows suggesting flexibility

---

## 7. Effects & Polish

### Glow Effects
- **Outer Glow:** Soft halo around bright elements, 5-15% opacity
- **Inner Glow:** Subtle edge lighting, creates volumetric feel
- **Color Glow:** Tinted glow matching element color (creates ambiance)

### Reflections
- Subtle floor reflection beneath floating objects (very faint)
- Environmental reflections on glossy surfaces
- Specular highlights suggesting light source

### Gradients Within Shapes
- Multi-stop gradients for complex color transitions
- Radial gradients for spherical appearance
- Mesh gradients for organic, fluid coloring

### Blur & Depth of Field
- Background blur for layered compositions
- Gaussian blur at 5-20px for atmospheric effect
- Motion blur only if suggesting movement

---

## 8. Composition Principles

### Visual Balance
- **Centered:** Symbol sits in optical center (classical, stable)
- **Dynamic:** Slight offset creates energy and movement
- **Asymmetric:** Intentional imbalance with visual counterweight

### Negative Space
- Generous whitespace/breathing room
- Background is part of the design, not just empty
- Negative space can form secondary shapes

### Focal Point
- One clear area of highest contrast/detail
- Eye should land on most important element first
- Supporting elements recede visually

### Scale Contrast
- Mix of large and small elements creates interest
- Primary symbol dominates, details are subtle
- Avoid cluttering with equal-sized elements

---

## 9. Style Variations

### Minimal Dark
- Black or very dark background
- Single bright element or monochromatic symbol
- High contrast, dramatic feel
- Examples: Flame icon, stocks chart

### Vibrant Gradient
- Multi-color gradient backgrounds
- White or light symbols on top
- Energetic, modern feel
- Examples: Telegram, Books app

### Soft & Light
- Light, airy backgrounds (white, pastels)
- Colorful symbols with soft shadows
- Friendly, approachable feel
- Examples: Altitude app, gesture icons

### Glassmorphic
- Translucent, frosted elements
- Layered shapes with varying opacity
- Contemporary, sophisticated feel
- Examples: Shortcuts icon, overlapping shapes

### 3D Rendered
- Realistic 3D objects
- Complex lighting and materials
- Premium, tangible feel
- Examples: Sphere, airplane, book

## Director Variation Grid: One Still, Eight Auteur Re-Shoots

Generates creative image prompts for director variation grid: one still, eight auteur re-shoots.

```text
Create a single 3x3 grid image (square, 2048x2048, high detail).
The center tile (row 2, col 2) must be the exact uploaded reference film still, unchanged. Do not reinterpret, repaint, relight, recolor, crop, reframe, stylize, sharpen, blur, or transform it in any way. It must remain exactly as provided.

Director detection rule
If the director of the uploaded film still is one of the 8 directors listed below, then the tile for that same director must be an exact duplicate of the ORIGINAL center tile, with no changes at all (same image content, same framing, same colors, same lighting, same texture). Only apply the label.
All other tiles follow the normal re-shoot rules.

Grid rules
9 equal tiles in a clean 3x3 layout, thin uniform gutters between tiles.
Each tile has a simple, readable label in the top-left corner, consistent font and size, high contrast, no warping.
Center tile label: ORIGINAL
Other tiles labels exactly:
Alfred Hitchcock
Akira Kurosawa
Federico Fellini
Andrei Tarkovsky
Ingmar Bergman
Jean-Luc Godard
Agnès Varda
Sergio Leone
No other text, logos, subtitles, or watermarks.
Keep the 3x3 alignment perfectly straight and clean.

IDENTITY + GENDER LOCK (applies to ALL non-ORIGINAL tiles)
- Use the ORIGINAL center tile as the single source of truth for every person’s identity.
- Preserve the exact number of people and their roles/positions (no swapping who is who).
- Do NOT change any person’s gender or gender presentation. No gender swap, no sex change, no cross-casting.
- Keep each person’s key identity traits consistent: face structure, hairstyle length/type, facial hair (must NOT appear/disappear), makeup level (must NOT appear/disappear), body proportions, age range, skin tone, and distinctive features (moles/scars/glasses).
- Do not turn one person into a different person. Do not merge faces. Do not split one person into two. Do not duplicate the same face across different people.
- If any identity attribute is ambiguous, default to matching the ORIGINAL exactly.
- Allowed changes are ONLY cinematic treatment per director: framing, lens feel, camera height, DOF, lighting, palette, contrast curve, texture, mood, and set emphasis. Identities must remain locked.
NEGATIVE: gender swap, femininize/masculinize, add/remove beard, add/remove lipstick, change hair length drastically, face replacement, identity drift.

CAST ANCHORING
- Person A = left-most person in ORIGINAL, Person B = right-most person in ORIGINAL, Person C = center/back person in ORIGINAL, etc.
- Each tile must keep Person A/B/C as the same individuals (same gender presentation and identity), only reshot cinematically.

Content rules (for non-duplicate tiles)
Maintain recognizable continuity across all tiles (who/where/what). Do not change identities into different people.
Vary per director: framing, lens feel, camera height, depth of field, lighting, color palette, contrast curve, texture, production design emphasis, mood.
Ultra-sharp cinematic stills (except where diffusion is specified), coherent lighting, correct anatomy, no duplicated faces, no mangled hands, no broken perspective, no glitch artifacts, and perfectly readable labels.

Director-specific style and color grading (apply strongly per tile, unless the duplicate rule applies)

Alfred Hitchcock
Palette: muted neutrals, cool grays, sickly greens, deep blacks, occasional saturated red accent.
Contrast: high contrast with crisp, suspenseful shadows.
Texture: classic 35mm cleanliness with tense atmosphere.

Palette: near-monochrome restraint, cold grays, pale skin tones, minimal color distractions.
Contrast: high contrast, sculpted faces, deep shadows.
Texture: clean, intimate, psychologically focused.
Lens/DOF: 50–85mm, tighter framing, shallow-to-medium DOF.
Lighting: strong key with dramatic falloff, emotionally intense portraits.

Jean-Luc Godard
Palette: bold primaries (red/blue/yellow) punctuating neutrals, or intentionally flat natural colors.
Contrast: medium contrast, occasional slightly overexposed highlights.
Texture: raw 16mm/35mm energy, imperfect and alive.
Lens/DOF: wider lenses, spontaneous off-center composition.
Lighting: available light feel, street/neon/practicals, documentary new-wave immediacy.

Agnès Varda
Palette: warm natural daylight, gentle pastels, honest skin tones, subtle complementary colors.
Contrast: medium, soft and inviting.
Texture: tactile lived-in realism, subtle film grain.
Lens/DOF: 28–50mm, environmental portrait framing with context.
Lighting: naturalistic, human-first, intimate but open atmosphere.

Sergio Leone
Palette: sunbaked golds, dusty oranges, sepia browns, deep shadows, occasional turquoise sky tones.
Contrast: high contrast, harsh sun, strong silhouettes.
Texture: gritty dust, sweat, leather, weathered surfaces, pronounced grain.
Lens/DOF: extreme wide (24–35mm) and extreme close-up language; shallow DOF for eyes/details.
Lighting/Mood: hard sunlight, rim light, operatic tension, iconic dramatic shadow shapes.

Output: a single final 3x3 grid image only.

## Dual Lighting Narrative Scene

Generates creative image prompts for dual lighting narrative scene.

```text
A woman in her late 20s sits on the floor beside a spinning record player, bathed in magenta and teal light. She wears a silky slip dress and her bare legs are curled. The lighting creates soft gradients across her skin, mixing warm and cool hues. A few records are scattered on the carpet.

Shot on a Pentax Spotmatic with a 50mm Super-Takumar lens at f/1.4, the frame is rich with bold contrasts and textured grain. A woman in her late 20s sits at a wooden kitchen table, a single shaft of sunlight from a nearby window illuminating her face and hands, the rest of the room in deep shadow. She wears a thin-strapped slip, her hair loose and softly disheveled. The light paints her features like a classical painting, catching the rim of a coffee cup and the curve of her shoulder. Behind her, the darkened room feels almost stage-like.

## Harry Potter / Marauder’s Map

Generates creative image prompts for harry potter / marauder’s map.

```text
Render the city of ${city_name} as a hidden magical wizarding world map inspired by the Harry Potter universe, in the style of the Marauder’s Map.

Preserve the real geographic layout, roads, districts, coastline, rivers and landmarks of ${city_name}, but reinterpret them as enchanted locations within a secret wizarding realm concealed from the muggle world.

Government districts appear as the Ministry of Magical Affairs, with enchanted towers, floating runes and protective wards.
Universities and schools become Wizarding Academies, spell libraries, observatories and arcane towers.
Historic and old town areas transform into Ancient Wizard Quarters, secret alleys, cursed ruins, hidden chambers and forgotten passages.
Industrial zones are depicted as Potion Breweries, Enchanted Workshops, Magical Foundries and alchemical factories.
Parks, forests, hills and valleys become Forbidden Forests, Herbology Grounds, Sacred Groves and Magical Creature Habitats.
Commercial districts appear as Diagon Alley–style magical markets, wizard shops, inns, taverns and trading corridors.
Stadiums and large arenas are transformed into Grand Quidditch Pitches.
Airports, ports and major transit hubs become Portkey Stations, Floo Network Gates, Sky Docks and Dragon Arrival Towers.

Include living magical map elements: moving footprints, glowing ink runes, whispered annotations, secret passage indicators, spell circles, magical wards, shifting pathways, hidden rooms, creature lairs, danger warnings, enchanted symbols and animated markings that feel alive and mysterious.

Art style: hand-drawn ink illustration, aged parchment texture, warm sepia tones, sketchy and whimsical linework, subtle magical glow, slightly imperfect hand-drawn look.
Typography: handwritten magical calligraphy, uneven ink strokes, old wizard script.
Decorative elements: ornate parchment borders, magical seals, wax stamps, enchanted footprints crossing paths, classic wizarding compass rose.

No modern elements, no sci-fi, no contemporary typography.
Aspect ratio: ${aspect_ratio}.
The map should feel like a living, enchanted artifact — a secret wizard’s map created by ancient witches and wizards.

The figures are rendered in a variety of bold colors, including a bright blue starfish-like creature, a fuzzy black blob with a triangular nose, a vibrant orange star-shaped being, and a lime green amorphous shape. These characters are packed tightly together, creating a sense of a dense, bustling community. The background is a dark, textured black, which makes the colorful figures pop. The overall style is whimsical and slightly unsettling, with a textured, crayon-like aesthetic.

## Through the Glass: One Eye in Focus

Generates creative image prompts for through the glass: one eye in focus.

```text
A cinematic, close-up portrait of a reference photo viewed through a reflective glass window. She has messy dark brown hair and hyper-realistic skin texture with visible pores, fine lines, and natural imperfections. One green-hazel eye is in sharp, crystal-clear focus, fully visible and unobstructed by reflections or highlights, while the rest of her face gradually softens into the background with an organic depth falloff.

The glass surface in the foreground is covered with realistic rain droplets and subtle rain streaks, creating layered depth and emotional distance. Reflections are carefully controlled and positioned only around the edges of the frame, never crossing or obscuring the focused eye or key facial features.

Moody, low-key lighting with warm glowing yellow and orange bokeh lights reflecting softly on the glass. The bokeh remains diffused and offset to the sides, enhancing atmosphere without blocking facial clarity. Shot with an extremely shallow depth of field (f/1.2), cinematic composition, emotional tone, natural optical blur, and realistic light behavior.

Photorealistic rendering, high-resolution detail, preserved film grain, natural skin texture, no over-smoothing, no artificial sharpness, no plastic or synthetic look.

## Transform Subjects into Adorable Plush Forms

Generates creative image prompts for transform subjects into adorable plush forms.

```text
Transform the subject or image into a cute plush form with soft textures and rounded shapes. If the image contains a human, preserve the distinctive features so the subject remains recognizable. Otherwise, turn the object or animal into an adorable plush toy using felt or fleece textures. It should have a warm felt or fleece look, simple shapes, and gently crafted eyes, mouth, and facial details. Use a heartwarming pastel or neutral color palette, smooth shading, and subtle stitching to evoke a handmade plush toy. Give it a friendly, cute facial expression, a slightly oversized head, short limbs, and a soft, huggable silhouette. The final image should feel charming, collectible, and like a genuine plush toy. It should be cute, heart-warming, and inviting to hug, while still clearly preserving the recognizability of the original subject.

## Turkish woman in Ankara with a surreal twist

Generates creative image prompts for turkish woman in ankara with a surreal twist.

```text
Ultra-realistic amateur street photo of a 27-year-old Turkish-looking curvy woman walking alone in the middle of a busy Ankara street, soft slightly chubby figure, blonde hair loose around her shoulders, wearing a tight white tank top and patterned high-waisted pants that show her curves, small crossbody bag hanging at her side. She walks toward the camera with a calm, almost bored expression.

Behind her, a chaotic Ankara environment: large white road signs pointing to “Eskişehir” and “Kızılay,” yellow taxis jammed in traffic, old apartment buildings with balconies on both sides of the street, pedestrians in darker jackets walking ahead of her or standing on the sidewalks. It feels like a typical slightly chaotic Turkish traffic scene.

Absurd twist: towering in the distance behind her is a gigantic döner kebab kaiju, made of layers of meat and bread stacked like a skyscraper, slowly rotating on an impossibly huge vertical skewer. The döner monster looms over the buildings, its top disappearing into the hazy sky. Tiny cartoonish firefighters at its base spray jets of white yogurt sauce at it from miniature fire hoses. Yellow taxis are stuck in a ring around the base of the döner kaiju, some drivers leaning out of their windows filming the monster with their phones.

Turkish brands appear naturally in the environment: a distant orange Migros supermarket sign stuck on one apartment block, a bright yellow Şok sign over a tiny side-market entrance, a Turkcell shop on the ground floor with its blue logo partly visible behind some pedestrians, and small Ülker and Eti snack billboards on the sides of buildings and on a bus stop. All of the brand signs are slightly out of focus but still readable enough to feel authentically Turkish and grounded in Ankara.

Shot on a regular iPhone by someone walking a few steps behind her: handheld, slightly shaky, vertical framing. She is not centered in the frame; she is placed a little to one side, and part of a yellow taxi and part of the huge döner kaiju are cut off at the edge of the image, as if the photographer couldn’t perfectly frame everything in time. Automatic exposure with a slightly blown-out pale sky at the top of the frame, no studio lighting, just normal soft afternoon daylight.

The photo quality feels like a quick phone snapshot: slight motion blur on the moving pedestrians, cars, and the spinning döner monster; digital noise in the shadow areas under balconies and under the monster; a mild lens flare from the sun hitting the phone lens at an angle; unedited, slightly imperfect colors; natural skin texture with pores and small imperfections visible on the woman’s face and arms. Casual but surreal body language, with a completely realistic everyday Ankara street transformed by the ridiculously huge döner kaiju, clearly not a professional camera or staged studio shoot.

## Turn Your Photo Into a Simpsons Scene

Generates creative image prompts for turn your photo into a simpsons scene.

```text
Use the uploaded photo as the ONLY reference for composition and subjects. Recreate it as a clean, believable still frame from “The Simpsons” (classic seasons look), with consistent show-accurate character design and background painting.

Core requirement
- EVERY visible subject in the photo must be converted into a Simpsons-style character, including:
  - Multiple humans
  - Babies/children
  - Pets and animals (cats, dogs, birds, etc.)
- Do not keep any subject photorealistic. No “half-real, half-cartoon” results.

Identity and count lock
- Keep the exact number of humans and animals.
- Keep each subject’s position, relative size, pose, gesture, and gaze direction.
- Keep key identity cues per subject: hairstyle, facial hair, glasses, distinctive accessories, clothing type, and overall vibe.
- Do NOT merge people, remove animals, invent extra characters, or swap who is who.

Simpsons character design rules (must match the show)
- Skin: Simpsons yellow for humans, with show-typical flat fills.
- Eyes: large white round eyes with small black dot pupils (no detailed irises).
- Nose: simple rounded nose shape, minimal lines.
- Mouth: simple linework, subtle overbite feel when fitting.
- Hands: 4 fingers for humans (Simpsons standard).
- Linework: clean black outlines, uniform thickness, no sketchy strokes.
- Shading: minimal cel-style shading only, no realistic shadows or textures.

Animals conversion rules (show-accurate)
- Convert each animal into a Simpsons-like version:
  - Simplified body shapes, bold outlines, flat colors
  - Expressive but simple face: dot pupils, minimal muzzle detail
- Keep species readable and preserve unique markings (spots, fur color blocks) in simplified form.

Clothing and accessories
- Keep the original outfits and accessories but simplify details into flat color blocks.
- Preserve logos/patterns only if they were clearly present, but simplify heavily.
- No added text on clothing.

Background and environment
- Convert the background into a Simpsons Springfield-like environment that matches the original setting:
  - If indoors: simple pastel walls, clean props, basic perspective, typical sitcom staging.
  - If outdoors: bright sky, simplified buildings/trees, Springfield color palette.
- Keep major background objects (tables, phones, chairs, signs) but simplify to animation props.
- Do not change the location type (do not move it to Moe’s, Kwik-E-Mart, or the Simpsons house unless the original already matches that kind of place).

Camera and framing
- Match the original camera angle, lens feel, crop, and spacing.
- Keep it as a single TV frame, not a poster.

Quality and negatives
- No text, subtitles, captions, watermarks, logos, UI, or borders.
- No 3D, no painterly look, no anime, no caricature exaggeration beyond Simpsons norms.
- No uncanny face drift: characters must look like Simpsons characters while still clearly mapping to each subject in the photo.
- High resolution, crisp edges, clean colors, looks like an actual episode screenshot.

## Ultra-Photorealistic Romantic Cinematic Scene in the Rain

Generates creative image prompts for ultra-photorealistic romantic cinematic scene in the rain.

```text
Faces must remain 100% identical to the reference with absolute identity lock: no face change, no beautification, no symmetry correction, no age shift, no skin smoothing, no expression alteration, same facial proportions, eyes, nose, lips, jawline, and natural texture. Ultra-photorealistic cinematic night scene in the rain where a romantic couple stands very close under a yellow umbrella in a softly lit garden. Heavy rain is falling, illuminated by warm golden fairy lights and street lamps creating dreamy bokeh in the background, with wet ground reflecting the light. The man holds the umbrella and looks at the woman with a gentle, loving gaze, while the woman looks up at him with a soft, warm, romantic smile. They never break eye contact, fully absorbed in each other, conveying deep emotional connection. Elegant coats slightly wet from the rain, realistic fabric texture, subtle rim light outlining their faces, visible raindrops and mist, shallow depth of field, 50mm lens look, natural film grain, high-end cinematic color grading. Only lighting, atmosphere, and environment may change — the faces and identities must remain completely unchanged and perfectly preserved.

## Ultra-Realistic Amateur Street Photo of Ankara Scene

Generates creative image prompts for ultra-realistic amateur street photo of ankara scene.

```text
Ultra-realistic amateur street photo of the same 27-year-old Turkish-looking curvy woman in Ankara, soft slightly chubby figure, blonde hair loose, tight white tank top, patterned high-waisted pants, small crossbody bag. She’s walking down the street, glancing over her shoulder at a yellow taxi completely filled with fluffy cats climbing around inside and pressing their faces to the windows.
Behind her, large road signs point to Eskişehir and Kızılay. More yellow taxis, some normal, some with cats poking their heads out of partially open windows. Old apartment buildings with balconies and pedestrians in darker jackets walking ahead, pretending everything is normal.
Turkish brands in the background: distant Migros sign, Şok sign over a tiny side market, Turkcell shop with its blue logo partly visible, small Ülker and Eti snack billboards. All slightly out of focus but readable.
Shot on a regular iPhone by someone walking a few steps behind her, handheld, slightly shaky, vertical framing, she’s off-center, one cat-filled taxi cut off on the edge of the frame. Automatic exposure, slightly blown-out sky, no studio lighting, normal afternoon daylight.
Photo quality feels like a quick phone snapshot: motion blur on some cats, slight blur on pedestrians and cars, digital noise in the shadows, lens flare, unedited colors, natural skin texture with pores and small imperfections. Everyday Ankara chaos but with absurd cat-filled taxis.

## Ultra-Realistic Ankara Apartment Night Scene

Generates creative image prompts for ultra-realistic ankara apartment night scene.

```text
Ultra-realistic amateur night photo, vertical phone snapshot from inside a small Ankara apartment, looking toward a window and catching the vibe of an “iyi geceler” tweet. The camera is low and slightly tilted, as if the photo was taken by someone lying or sitting on a couch. In the foreground, the armrest of a worn fabric sofa and a soft blanket are visible, slightly out of focus.

In the mid-ground, a 27-year-old Turkish-looking woman with a soft, slightly chubby figure stands near the window, back partially turned to the camera, phone in one hand at chest level, the other hand resting lightly on the window frame. She wears comfy, non-revealing home clothes: an oversized pastel sweatshirt and loose pajama pants with a simple pattern. Her blonde hair falls loosely down her back. You can’t read the phone screen; it only casts a subtle blue glow on her face and hand, suggesting she has just posted a tweet.

Outside the window, the street is lit by a bright sodium-orange streetlamp, giving the buildings and parked cars a warm glow. A single yellow taxi is parked near the curb, slightly blurred. Across the street is an old apartment building with balconies, some windows dark and a few still lit. A small ground-floor Migros Jet or Şok market sign is visible, glowing softly, and a distant blue Turkcell shop sign and a tiny Ülker billboard are out of focus further down the street.

Inside the room, only a floor lamp with a warm bulb is on, casting a low, cozy light that contrasts with the cold bluish light from outside. Shadows pool in the corners of the room; there is some clutter like a stack of books, a mug on a coffee table, and a TV remote. Vertical framing is slightly off; the woman is closer to the right edge, part of the window frame is cut off, and a lamp shade intrudes at the top, making it feel like an honest, uncomposed phone shot.

There is visible high-ISO noise in the dark areas, slight motion blur on a car passing outside, and no strong color grading—just natural warm and cool lights mixing. The whole mise-en-scène should feel like a peaceful moment in a real Ankara apartment, seconds after quietly saying “iyi geceler” to the timeline.

## Ultra-Realistic Ankara Street Photo with Surreal Element

Generates creative image prompts for ultra-realistic ankara street photo with surreal element.

```text
Ultra-realistic amateur street photo of a 27-year-old Turkish-looking curvy woman in Ankara, same soft slightly chubby figure, blonde hair loose around her shoulders, tight white tank top and patterned high-waisted pants, small crossbody bag. She’s walking down a busy Ankara street while casually trying to balance a giant simit the size of a car on one hand, looking slightly confused but amused.
Behind her, large road signs still point to Eskişehir and Kızılay. Yellow taxis are stuck in traffic because the enormous rolling simit is blocking part of the road. Old apartment buildings with balconies, pedestrians in darker jackets taking photos of the simit with their phones, typical slightly chaotic Turkish traffic.
In the background, a distant Migros supermarket sign, a tiny Şok side market, and a Turkcell shop with its blue logo partly visible. Small Ülker and Eti snack billboards seem ironically normal compared to the absurd giant simit. All background elements are slightly out of focus but readable enough to feel authentically Turkish.
Shot on a regular iPhone by someone walking a few steps behind her, handheld, slightly shaky, vertical framing. She is not centered, the huge simit is partly cut off on one side, automatic exposure, a bit of blown-out sky, no studio lighting, normal afternoon daylight.
Photo quality feels like a quick phone snapshot: slight motion blur on people and cars, digital noise in shadow areas, lens flare from the sun, unedited colors, natural skin texture with pores and small imperfections, casual, unintentionally funny body language, and a realistic everyday Ankara street environment with one completely absurd element.

## Ultra-Realistic Night Scene in a Turkish Kitchen

Generates creative image prompts for ultra-realistic night scene in a turkish kitchen.

```text
Ultra-realistic, lightly comedic night scene in a small old-fashioned Turkish kitchen, vertical framing. Only two light sources: the open fridge casting a cold white light, and a dim yellow ceiling lamp. A 27-year-old Turkish-looking curvy blonde woman with a soft figure stands barefoot in front of the open fridge in cozy pyjamas: loose shorts with a silly pattern (maybe eggs or cats) and a slightly tight grey sleep t-shirt, hair messy from the day.

She holds her phone in one hand at chest level, screen lighting her face in a bluish tint, thumb mid-tap as she types an “iyi geceler” tweet while clearly preparing a completely unnecessary midnight snack. With her other hand she grabs a piece of leftover börek or a plate of sliced sucuk and cheese from the fridge. Her expression is a mix of guilty pleasure and “whatever, yarın diyete başlarım” energy.

The kitchen is cluttered and very Turkish: hanging dried peppers and eggplants on the wall, shelves full of spice jars and tea glasses, old patterned tiles as backsplash. On the small counter, there’s a simit on a plate, an empty tea glass, a jar of olives, a half-cut tomato on a wooden board, and a pink apron thrown over a chair (matching the earlier cooking scenes). A small wall calendar with a landscape, a fridge magnet from a holiday, and random notes are stuck to the fridge door. Some visible brands: a Migros plastic bag hanging on a cabinet handle, a Şok discount leaflet half crumpled on the table, a box of Ülker biscuits and Eti snacks in a corner, a tiny Turkcell modem with blinking lights on the kitchen shelf.

The vertical framing feels like a quick snap someone took from the doorway: she’s slightly off-center, the top of the fridge is cut off, and part of a chair intrudes into the frame. Slight motion blur on her hand reaching into the fridge, noticeable noise in the darker parts of the room, and a bit of lens flare or haze from the bright fridge light. No retouching on skin; you can see texture and small imperfections on her legs and arms. The whole mise-en-scène is the exact vibe of tweeting “iyi geceler” while absolutely not going to sleep yet.

## Ultra-Realistic Turkish Living Room Scene During Football Match

Generates creative image prompts for ultra-realistic turkish living room scene during football match.

```text
Ultra-realistic Turkish TV-series style night photo, vertical framing like a phone snapshot. Interior of a slightly cluttered Ankara living room during a football match on TV. Warm yellow ceiling light and the blue glow from the TV, no studio gloss. In the center of the frame, a 27-year-old Turkish-looking curvy blonde woman with a soft, slightly chubby figure is half-lying, half-sitting on an old patterned couch. She wears a slightly tight grey t-shirt and cotton shorts, or an oversized cartoon t-shirt as a nightdress, bare legs tucked under a blanket. Her hair is a bit messy from the day.

On the low coffee table in front of her: a couple of opened **Efes Pilsen 50 cl bottles** with blue-and-gold labels facing the camera, one half-drunk, one with condensation; an **Efes Draft barrel-shaped can** lying on its side; a bowl of chips, a plate with sliced sucuk and cheese, and some scattered Ülker and Eti snack wrappers. There are a few **Efes-branded coasters** under the bottles and a small blue **Efes Pilsen ashtray** with a single stubbed-out cigarette, giving strong bar-at-home energy without going overboard on drinking.

Around her on the couch and nearby chairs sit her older relatives and neighbors: one amca in a checked shirt yelling at the TV, another already dozing; an auntie in a floral headscarf holding a small tea glass; someone else holding a bottle of **Efes Malt** instead of tea. The TV in the background shows a blurry football match with a scoreboard in the corner, but no team logos need to be legible.

The woman is holding her phone with both hands, positioned just above the blanket, thumbs mid-typing. The screen is glowing bluish, clearly a social media app: she is about to post an “iyi geceler” tweet even though the room is still loud. Her expression is slightly ironic, like “iyi geceler ama ev susmuyor.”

The living-room decor is classic Turkish: patterned carpet on the floor, lace curtains, a wall calendar with a mosque photo, a framed calligraphy piece, and maybe a small scarf with a team logo hanging near the TV. In the corner, instead of any supermarket branding, there is a small **Efes Pilsen promotional poster** taped slightly crookedly to the wall and a stack of empty **Efes Pilsen crates** partly visible in a dark corner, as if leftovers from a house party.

The framing is imperfect and handheld: she’s a bit off-center, part of one uncle is cut off at the edge, the coffee table is slightly skewed. There is minor motion blur on the gesturing uncle and the flickering TV, plus visible digital noise in the darker corners and under furniture, keeping the phone-photo feeling. Colors are warm and natural, with the blue TV light and blue Efes labels popping subtly but not like an advertisement. Skin textures and small imperfections are clearly visible on everyone. The whole mise-en-scène feels like a realistic Ankara match night that ends with an “iyi geceler” tweet and a few Efes bottles on the table.

Create a high-resolution (64K, DSLR style) fashion collage using the submitted image as the sole identity reference, preserving 100% of the facial identity exactly as it is—same facial structure, proportions, skin tone, age, expression, eyes, nose, mouth, jawline, and overall identity, without any embellishment, stylization, regeneration, reinterpretation, or modification of the face.
The final image is a vertically divided urban fashion collage with three candid street-style photos on a contemporary European city street, featuring cobblestone sidewalks, historic architecture, neutral facades, and a modern, artistic, and vibrant atmosphere.
The subject appears confident, playful, and slightly rebellious, wearing modern bold female fashion consisting of a statement crop top or corset top, a sleek high-waisted mini skirt or tailored bold trousers, a striking oversized blazer or leather jacket, fashionable heeled boots or bold sneakers, stylish accessories, a small shoulder bag, and visible white wireless headphones in some frames.
The left panel shows a reflection in a mirror through glass, with the model holding a smartphone, superimposed on subtle urban reflections.
The upper right panel is a photo taken from above, looking down, as she leans toward the camera with a playful pout and natural perspective distortion.
The lower right panel is a close-up selfie where she looks directly at the camera while holding an iced coffee in a clear plastic cup, with her headphones visible, illuminated by soft natural light.
Overlay a minimalist, semi-transparent music player interface floating in the center of the collage, displaying a Linkin Park track with title, progress bar, and play/pause controls, harmoniously integrated into a lifestyle aesthetic depicting a day in the life, focusing on music.
Use only natural light, soft shadows, realistic highlights, a discreet earthy palette (shades of brown, gray, and warm yellow), subtle grain, and a slightly desaturated editorial color gradation, resulting in a modern and realistic editorial style typical of Instagram.

## Vision-to-json

Generates creative image prompts for vision-to-json.

```text
This is a request for a System Instruction (or "Meta-Prompt") that you can use to configure a Gemini Gem. This prompt is designed to force the model into a hyper-analytical mode where it prioritizes completeness and granularity over conversational brevity.



System Instruction / Prompt for "Vision-to-JSON" Gem



Copy and paste the following block directly into the "Instructions" field of your Gemini Gem:



ROLE & OBJECTIVE



You are VisionStruct, an advanced Computer Vision & Data Serialization Engine. Your sole purpose is to ingest visual input (images) and transcode every discernible visual element—both macro and micro—into a rigorous, machine-readable JSON format.



CORE DIRECTIVEDo not summarize. Do not offer "high-level" overviews unless nested within the global context. You must capture 100% of the visual data available in the image. If a detail exists in pixels, it must exist in your JSON output. You are not describing art; you are creating a database record of reality.



ANALYSIS PROTOCOL



Before generating the final JSON, perform a silent "Visual Sweep" (do not output this):



Macro Sweep: Identify the scene type, global lighting, atmosphere, and primary subjects.



Micro Sweep: Scan for textures, imperfections, background clutter, reflections, shadow gradients, and text (OCR).



Relationship Sweep: Map the spatial and semantic connections between objects (e.g., "holding," "obscuring," "next to").



OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)



You must return ONLY a single valid JSON object. Do not include markdown fencing (like ```json) or conversational filler before/after. Use the following schema structure, expanding arrays as needed to cover every detail:

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS



Granularity: Never say "a crowd of people." Instead, list the crowd as a group object, but then list visible distinct individuals as sub-objects or detailed attributes (clothing colors, actions).



Micro-Details: You must note scratches, dust, weather wear, specific fabric folds, and subtle lighting gradients.



Null Values: If a field is not applicable, set it to null rather than omitting it, to maintain schema consistency.



the final output must be in a code box with a copy button.

## Where the Kami Still Walk

Generates creative image prompts for where the kami still walk.

```text
Ancient Japanese village at night, quiet and empty, deeply spiritual atmosphere. Traditional wooden houses lining a narrow stone street, wet from recent rain, reflecting soft warm paper lantern light. Low mist drifting slowly through the village, moving with intention, as if guided by an unseen presence. Paper lanterns glowing gently one by one, with no visible source of ignition. At the end of the street, an old moss-covered torii gate emerging from the fog. Behind it, a subtle sacred presence — no physical form, no face — only a soft, breathing glow within the mist, calm and ancient, watching without judgment, like a shintō kami. An old tree beside the path wrapped with a weathered shimenawa rope. Shide paper streamers moving slightly despite the still air. Footsteps visible on the wet stone ground, leading forward like a quiet ritual path. Mood of reverence, silence, and timelessness. The boundary between the visible world and the unseen feels thin and sacred. Cinematic composition with strong leading lines and deep perspective. Volumetric fog, soft natural light diffusion. Color palette of deep indigo blues, muted forest greens, and warm amber highlights. Photorealistic cinematic realism, ultra-detailed organic textures, natural imperfections, subtle asymmetry, atmospheric concept art, high resolution, 8K quality.

Negative prompt: anime, cartoon, illustration, horror, aggressive mood, monsters, demons, jump scare, modern buildings, neon lights, cyberpunk, city elements, text, watermark, logo, characters in foreground, sharp artificial lighting, oversaturated colors

## World of Darkness B&W style

Generates creative image prompts for world of darkness b&w style.

```text
${subject} rendered in harsh, angular World of Darkness comic-book linework. Heavy black inks dominate the image, with thick contour lines, aggressive cross-hatching, and deep shadow blocks carving the form into sharp anatomical planes. Anatomy exaggerated and expressive, posture tense and confrontational. Surfaces broken into stark light-versus-dark geometry. Background abstracted or urban-gothic, fragmented and oppressive. Lighting stark and noir-inspired, extreme contrast with hard rim light defining edges and silhouettes. Composition tight and intimate, low or confrontational camera angle. Overall tone: modern gothic horror, raw, feral, and spiritually charged.
```

## World of Darkness Colored Comic style

Generates creative image prompts for world of darkness colored comic style.

```text
${subject} rendered in the distinctive colored World of Darkness comic style used in classic Werewolf books. Heavy black inks remain the structural backbone—thick contour lines, aggressive cross-hatching, deep shadow blocks—overlaid with saturated, moody color washes. Color applied in layered, expressive fields rather than realism, shifting across form to suggest emotion and supernatural presence. Highlights sharp and metallic, selectively catching edges, eyes, weapons, or key features. Background painted in a gritty WoD palette of sickly yellows, rusted reds, bruised purples, and cold violets. Colors bleed slightly outside ink boundaries, creating chaotic, feral energy. Texture rough, painterly, and grim. Composition confrontational and intimate. Tone: urban gothic horror, animistic power, menace restrained just beneath the surface.

## Young Saudi Doctor in a Professional Setting

Generates creative image prompts for young saudi doctor in a professional setting.

```text
Create a photorealistic image of a young Saudi doctor seen from the back, seated on a simple chair in front of a wooden desk. The doctor has short dark hair, a well-proportioned physique, and an air of calm and confident professionalism. He is wearing a white Saudi thobe with a clean medical coat over it. A stethoscope is naturally draped around his neck, simple and realistic, without exaggeration.

In front of him, there is a large desktop computer screen with soft white lighting. The wooden desk is simple, with a small potted plant on one side and a simple vase on the other. The design is balanced and centered.

The background is white with soft natural lighting, casting gentle shadows. The image should have realistic shading and depth, with smooth color transitions and clear shapes with precise realistic details.

The atmosphere is calm, professional, and deep. High-quality 8k, polished, realistic with an artistic touch.
