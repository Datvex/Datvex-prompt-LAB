## NOOMS Brand Story & Portfolio Background – Storytelling Format

Creates logo and branding concepts for nooms brand story & portfolio background – storytelling format.

```text
I want to create a brand story and portfolio background for my footwear brand. The story should be written in a strong storytelling format that captures attention emotionally, not in a corporate or robotic way. The goal is to build a brand identity, not just explain a business. The brand name is NOOMS. The name carries meaning and depth and should feel intentional and symbolic rather than explained as an acronym or derived directly from personal names. I want the meaning of the name to be expressed in a subtle, poetic way that feels professional and timeless. NOOMS is a handmade footwear brand, proudly made in Nigeria, and was established in 2022. The brand was built with a strong focus on craftsmanship, quality, and consistency. Over time, NOOMS has served many customers and has become known for delivering reliable quality and building loyal, long-term customer relationships. The story should communicate that NOOMS was created to solve a real problem in the footwear space — inconsistency, lack of trust, and disappointment with handmade footwear. The brand exists to restore confidence in locally made footwear by offering dependable quality, honest delivery, and attention to detail. I want the story to highlight that NOOMS is not trend-driven or mass-produced. It is intentional, patient, and purpose-led. Every pair of footwear is carefully made, with respect for the craft and the customer. The brand should stand out as one that values people, not just sales. Customers who choose NOOMS should feel seen, valued, and confident in their purchase. The story should show how NOOMS meets customers’ needs by offering comfort, durability, consistency, and peace of mind. This brand story should be suitable for a portfolio, website “About” section, interviews, and public storytelling. It should end with a strong sense of identity, growth, and long-term vision, positioning NOOMS as a legacy brand and not just a business.
