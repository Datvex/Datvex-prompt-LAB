## Hyper-Realistic Cinematic Pre-Dawn Scene in Ancient Mecca

Defines music genres, moods, and structures for hyper-realistic cinematic pre-dawn scene in ancient mecca.

```text
Create a hyper-realistic cinematic pre-dawn scene in ancient Mecca, viewed from a high overhead camera angle above the roof of the Kaaba, looking diagonally downward toward its lower corner and the wide open ground surrounding it. The scene includes:

- The Kaaba standing alone at the center of a large open sandy courtyard, with uneven, dusty ground made of compacted sand and dry soil.
- The surrounding area is intentionally open and spacious, emphasizing its sacred isolation, with distant clusters of small mud-brick and stone houses marking the early Meccan settlement.
- Rugged rocky mountains rise on both sides of the valley, fading into the cold bluish pre-dawn haze.
- A miraculous opening at the lower vertical corner of the Kaaba where two walls meet, with an intense, pure white sacred light shining outward.
- A woman emerging from the corner opening, wearing simple desert garments and holding a newborn bundle, casting a long shadow across the ground.
- Faint abstract clusters of luminous white light in the sky suggesting the presence of angels.

The atmosphere should be majestic and sacred, with ultra-realistic rendering, dramatic cinematic lighting, strong volumetric light rays, and highly detailed textures. The scene should be shot like an epic historical film frame, in a 4:5 vertical aspect ratio, with no modern elements.

## Ultra-Realistic Ankara Indie Bar Scene Description

Defines music genres, moods, and structures for ultra-realistic ankara indie bar scene description.

```text
Ultra-realistic Turkish indie-series night scene in a slightly alternative bar in Ankara’s hipster neighborhood, vertical frame like a phone story. Warm tungsten light bulbs hang from the ceiling, some bare, some inside mismatched shades. Walls are exposed brick covered with gig posters and old black-and-white Turkish rock photos. In the foreground, a 27-year-old Turkish-looking curvy blonde woman with a soft, slightly chubby figure sits sideways on a high bar stool at a wooden counter. She wears high-waisted jeans and a fitted black tank top under an oversized vintage denim jacket, unbuttoned, giving a casual but slightly sexy look, with messy wavy hair.

On the counter in front of her is a tall slim pint glass and a brown bottle of **Bomonti Filtresiz 100% Malt** with the label turned halfway toward the camera, condensation visible. Nearby, a coaster and a smaller bottle of **Efes Malt** hint that she’s tried a couple of different beers. Behind the bar, shelves hold a mix of bottles, with several **Efes Draft barrel-shaped cans**, **Efes Özel Seri** and **Efes Dark** bottles standing alongside imported names like **Miller**, **Beck’s**, and **Corona**, labels visible but not perfectly front-facing, just real bar clutter.

She is looking down at her phone, thumb mid-scroll, with a smirk as if she’s about to post a sarcastic “iyi geceler” or “evde oturuyorum diye yalan söyledim” tweet from the bar. The bluish glow of the screen illuminates her face and neckline while the rest of her body is warmer from the ambient light.

Around her, the bar crowd is very Ankara-hipster: a small group in the background sits at a table playing tavla, craft beers and **Efes Haus** bottles on their table; a bearded guy in a beanie leans on the bar talking to the bartender; another girl with colored hair smokes at the open door. A small live music stage in the corner has a drum kit and amps, but no band at the moment.

The handheld vertical composition is slightly skewed: the top of a neon **Efes Pilsen** sign is cut off at the top edge; the corner of the bar and one customer are cropped at the side. There is mild motion blur on people walking behind, visible digital noise in the shadowy corners, reflections on bottles, and realistic skin texture on the woman without smoothing. Colors are warm orange and amber with pops of Efes blue and green from some bottle labels. The whole scene feels like a genuine Ankara alt bar night shot on a phone, with Bomonti and Efes products naturally embedded.
